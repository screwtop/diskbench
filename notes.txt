These programs probably need to be run as root.

On NetBSD, be sure to use the "r" (character special) device when testing.  The block special device seems to give much lower sequential transfer rates.  I read recently (2007-03) that I/O using the block special devices go through the buffer cache (this might have been for Linux).  Indeed, character devices are unbuffered (read/written immediately), whereas the block devices are buffered (and possibly also cached).

TODO: have these bypass the filesystem cache on Linux.

1024 B = 1 kiB = 2 blocks
2048 B = 2 kiB = 4 blocks
8192 B = 8 kiB = 16 blocks
16384 B = 16 kiB = 32 blocks
32768 B = 32 kiB = 64 blocks
65536 B = 64 kiB = 128 blocks

random() produces numbers in the range 0..2^31-1, or 0..2 147 483 648

On Linux (2.6.??), clock_gettime() requires librt (-lrt).

TODO:
 - fix programs so that they don't segfault when run with no arguments!
 - add a "usage" output as well

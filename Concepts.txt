Introduction

   This is a supplementary document for the diskbench package
   describing some of the concepts and caveats relating to disk
   benchmarking, both in general and with specific reference to
   the diskbench utilities.

Caution

   diskbench is currently a work-in-progress and should be
   considered alpha-quality. Don't expect it to work, and use at
   your own risk!

Low-Level Performance Metrics

   There are three main low-level hard disk drive performance
   metrics: the access time, the sequential transfer rate, and the
   burst data rate. These will be discussed in the following
   sections.

Access Time, Seek Time, and Rotational Latency

   Access time is a measure of latency: how long must you wait
   before the drive begins reading (or writing) the data being
   transferred? Access time consists of two components: the seek
   time, which is how long the read-write head takes to reach the
   requested track, and rotational latency, which is how long
   before the requested sector passes undernead the read/write
   head. Rotational latency is a function of the rotational speed
   of the drive, and is uniformly distributed. Seek time is
   dependent on the size of the disk and the engineering of the
   read/write head actuator.

   The drive is essentially doing no useful work during a disk
   access, since it cannot read from or write to the disk during
   this time. What's worse, disk accesses can incur delays on the
   order of 10 milliseconds (around 30 million CPU clock cycles on
   2009 technology).

Sequential or Sustained Transfer Rate

   The sequential transfer rate (STR) is a measure of bandwidth or
   data rate: how fast can data be transferred to or from the
   physical disk medium without interruption. STR can be thought
   of as the maximum sustainable transfer rate supported by the
   drive.

   STR is probably the most familiar measure to computer users,
   and is commonly measured in megabytes per second (MB/s), or
   megabinary bytes per second (MiB/s). Sequential transfers are
   only observed when the data being read are physically
   contiguous on the disk, which usually only happens when a
   single process is accessing a single file on the disk. A single
   drive (2009 era) may be able to sustain in excess of 100 MiB/s,
   but the aggregate and per-process throughput will drop
   considerably as other, concurrent reads are added.

Burst or Cache Read/Write

   This is primarily a measure of the external interface of the
   disk drive, e.g. Serial ATA, SCSI, SAS. In most drives, data
   pass through a memory buffer/cache on the drive electronics in
   the process of being read or written. This memory is usually
   dynamic RAM (DRAM), and therefore much faster that the physical
   disk medium. On reads, the drive can read ahead, bringing
   sectors that are likely to be requested into the buffer/cache
   in anticipation of being requested. On writes, the data can be
   written into the buffer/cache, and flushed to the physical
   medium at a later time. The buffer/cache decouples the internal
   and external drive interfaces, improving throughput by allowing
   the two to operate asynchronously.

Performing Benchmarking, and Interpreting the Results

   There are lies, damned lies, and statistics, so the saying
   goes. It is virtually impossible to test the performance of one
   component of a computer system without being affected by other
   components. Disk benchmarks will be affected by the interface:
   for example, the bandwidth bottleneck for USB-connected drives
   is probably the interface, not the drive. On some systems, it
   may be impossible to avoid the effects of data caches and
   buffers, in particular those provided by the operating system,
   host adapter (if present), and the disk drive itself. Bridges
   in external drive enclosures may affect latency and bandwidth.
   However, under ideal conditions and if you keep your skeptical
   hat on, you should be able to get results that are fairly close
   to the mark and reproducible.
